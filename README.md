### NOTES & PRACTICES:

1. A developer can submit the app and opt for "developer release" which means the app is not automatically made available to the public untill the developer choose to.

2. Don't stress too much on SKU number. It can be any string (it shohuld make sense to you)

3. choose bundle Identifier wisely <br>
Format: `com.company.app-vertical` <br>
eg: `com.apple.pages`

###### AFTER SUBMISSION 
> _App is reviewed by apple review team_
 
1. It takes 3 hours to 7+ (working) days for app to be reviewed
2. For first time upload, it may take more than 3 days.

###### APP REJECTION 
>_App rejection is not a "cul-de-sac". So fix the issues and re submit_
Your app may be rejected due to following (popular) reasons
1. App has a _login_ screen but no *signup* page. (need to provide clarification)
2. Developers have used any private api (like giniee animation effect)
3. App crashes very often. 
4. bla bla bla
